Title: MolE-XGBoost
Description: A publicly available dataset accounting for the effect of 1, 197 marketed
  drugs against 40 bacterial strains was used to train an XGBoost model, termed MolE-XGBoost,
  that predicts growth inhibition using MolE pre-trained representations. The model
  enabled a concise assessment of the antimicrobial potential of chemical compounds,
  including the re-discovery of de novo structurally distinct antibiotic candidates
  and the identification of broad-spectrum activity in other compounds that would
  have been missed by standard models.
